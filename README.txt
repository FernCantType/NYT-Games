PROJECT TITLE: NYT_Games
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To solve all the New York Times games as they are annoying sometimes to solve.
VERSION or DATE: 11/11/2024
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the main method on any of the classes. Each class accords to one of the minigames the New York Times offers. I will make the input system easier eventually so you can copy and paste the information to the terminal.
AUTHORS: Lorenzo Canali
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Just follow the instructions printed to the terminal, if applicable. Otherwise, usually the terminal provides the answers right there but there is a chance for each process to "advance" to the next stage
